				<h2 class="w3-wide">Skills Building <i>More than Robots</i></h2>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Programming:</b> Although the programming team only needs to learn how to program the robot, we find a broad knowledge base is a good thing to have.
						<ul>
							<li>When we ask other teams why they use Java the overwhelming response is because their mentor forced them to so that it would bind well with AP CS (Java based class). This is sad as when we look at Java as a language, we can see that not only is it dying, but out of place in the realm of embedded systems programming. We use C++ as it is a stable language and has more practical applications. On the other hand, when we ask <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FRC/comments/4k24cu/java_vs_c/" target="_blank">which is better suited for robotics</a> the argument can go either way</li>
							<li>At our first meeting, all programming team members signed up for github and joined <a href="https://github.com/robobibb/">the RoboBibb organization</a>, in addition we discussed the merits of different software licenses. Github is the most common version control system and being able to use it is a valuable employability skill. RoboBibb is a team dedicated to open-source. All of the code we write here is posted publicly on GitHub.</li>
							<li>Linux is a powerful tool for a programmer to take advantage of. Although only a few members use it often, programing team can tell the advantages and disadvantages of using it, and have learned enough from it to benefit them when dealing with the RoboRIO which runs Linux.</li>
							<li>Programming team works together and collaborates on personal projects. This helps us build teamwork communication skills which are essential to our team’s success.</li>
							<li>Programming team has friends who live in oppressive regimes. Programming team members know how to utilize a multitude of security/privacy tools, (ie- VPN’s, proxies, firewalls, encryption, etc.)</li>
							<li>Programming team works together on math related problems and often incorporates math into our code.</li>
							<li>In order to learn how to use libraries we have to use the documentation provided, and in some cases translate examples written in different languages.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Mechanical:</b> mechanical is responsible for building the robot and making something that the other teams can work around. They generally lead the design phase.
						<ul>
							<li>Being able to express ideas is essential to mechanical's job, although we experiment in CAD occasionally, we find it's generally more time efficient to draw pictures and give explanations. Because of this, mechanical members develop a good ability of sketching and explaining.</li>
							<li>Given that mechanical team is larger than the other teams, organization of labor is essential to success. We have to get as many people working in parallel to work effectively. This leads to students who can find a role as soon as they enter the room as opposed to waiting to be given a command</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Electrical:</b> electrical gets valuable hands on experience with making the robot actually work.
						<ul>
							<li>In addition to doing electrical work, electrical team is also responsible for pneumatics.</li>
							<li>Both electrical and pneumatics require an eye for safety.</li>
							<li>In order to use parts we have to be able to read and understand white-sheets and other technical documentation</li>
							<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cableporn/" target="_blank">Effective wire-management</a> is an art which requires organization and patience.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Marketing:</b> Marketing team is similar to FBLA or DECA, but in real life and not just imagination.
						<ul>
							<li>By helping to maintain the team's finances, marketing learns how a functioning non-profit works.</li>
							<li>Working with businesses, donors, etc. requires effective communication skills and provides valuable business experience.</li>
							<li>In order to get people excited about our team and convince new members to join, merketing needs to use advertising skills to convince new members to join and people to support out team.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Scouting:</b> Scouting needs to figure out who’s the best pick for our alliance
						<ul>
							<li>Regardless of our ranking scouting team needs effective communication skills. If we're low, we need them to try and convince other teams to pick us. if we're high we need to get information about other teams that isn't biased so we can make good decisions.</li>
							<li>In order to make predictions for future competitions, scouting watches events which we don't participate in, and does analysis of those as well.</li>
							<li>Statistics are useful for making effective use of all our data.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>Drive:</b> drive team controls the robot and communicates with other teams. It’s not quite like playing video games
						<ul>
							<li>Communication skills are vital to working with other teams. In the heat of competition drivers and coaches need to keep a cool head.</li>
							<li>Drive team assists scouting team by giving information that they cannot measure, and thus they must also keep this in their mind.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
