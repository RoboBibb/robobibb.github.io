				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>Electrical team is responsible for wiring our robot. They draw out diagrams of the electrical board that often get changed multiple times throughout the season to fit best with the final robot. However, their job is not finished at the end of the build season. Many times problems will occur during competitions that need to be fixed quickly. This means performing under extreme pressure and time constraints. </p>
				<h3>During Build-Season</h3>
				<p>Electrical team designs and creates an electrical board for the robot. They do not just make one, but will have to edit the original several times before it is perfect. They study diagrams and use their knowledge to make a unique system each year. </p>

				<h3>During Competition</h3>
				<p>They prepare the robot to pass inspection at the beginning of the competition. Also, many times our robot will be damaged during competition so an electrical team member is always in the pit to solve any problems that might occur. After each competition is complete, they check each wire to ensure that they have not come damaged or detached.</p>
