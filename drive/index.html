				<h4>About</h4>
				<p>During competition, drive team gets to drive the robot around and competete in the game. However, their job isn't all fun and games. Many times there are technical issues which cause problems, robots break, errors occurr, etc. these require rapid problem-solving for us to stay competitive. Drive team has to talk with fellow alliance members to discuss strategy, and during the match we have to work with the other teams to reach our goals, this requires effective communication skills. In addition, if a referee makes an incorrect rulling, it's our drive-team's responsibility to confront them and - using gracious professionalism - point out their mistake. Arguing with a ref is a dangerous game, and communication skills are even more effective here. Drive team is responsible for the team spirit and their hype is contagious.</p>

				<h4>During Build-Season</h4>
				<p>Although our drivers often help out in the production of our robot, as soon as we get the game released, they begin a careful analysis of the rules and game mechanics. They commit important things such as point values and penalties to memory. The rest are kept in mind. Drivers must study the rules well enough to pass a rules test which will determine if they are ready for the task.</p>

				<h4>During Competition</h4>
				<p>Drive-team's time to shine. Our primary driver keeps his fingers practiced for driving by playing video games. Our secondary driver is given a short intro to the driver station and smart-dashboard setup from programming team. Troublshooting generally falls under their domain. The coach begins talking with alliance members and scoping out the other teams. The human players get to watch the other teams play and see their strategies and possible ways to improve ours.</p>

				<h3>Members - Coming soon :)</h3>
