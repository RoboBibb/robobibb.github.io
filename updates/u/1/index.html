					New mechanical team members got to use power tools like the saw for the first time today as they helped disassemble last yearâ€™s practice bot and worked on assembling the new robot. We finished work on the chassis and are now considering designs for cube drop off and intake. After we finished work, we did research to help generate design ideas. One of the topics we researched was ways to deliver cubes. Right now we are considering using pneumatics to create a dumping mechanism that will slide cubes off a platform. We are also looking into creating a mechanism that will successfully deliver cubes to the scale and climb. The most promising design for climbing at the moment is a tape measure device like the ones often seen in Stronghold. However, other opinions are circulating and our final design will most likely be a combination of several ideas. Once we come up with a solid plan, we hope to have our first robot completed within a week.
