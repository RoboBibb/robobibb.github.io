					Our first event of the season was a success! We ended the qualifiers ranked seventh and were the first pick of team 1648, G3 Robotics. We were joined by team 5848, Robo C3, and swept the playoff matches undefeated. At the awards ceremony, we not only got a blue banner, but we were awarded the Excellence in Engineering Award for our quick addition of a pool noodle mechanism that lowered to prevent us from being fouled when launching cubes into the switch. We are ecstatic about our win and are looking forward to our event in Columbus next week!
