					<h3>Sandman - SteamWorks (2017)</h3><hr/>

					<h4>Design and planning</h4>
					<p>Our goal every competition is to optimize cycle-time. By getting more points per cycle and performing more cycles per match we are more successful. This year we analyzed all the scoring methods of the game and picked the ones with the best gains vs. effort. We weighed our options: low-boiler gives very few points, not worth our time; high-boiler seemed point efficient if we could get a shooter which is both accurate and rapid-fire, which seemed unrealistic at the time; climbing is merely a free 50 points, we could throw it on essentially any robot we made; gears were easy to score with and very point efficient. We decided on a robot which focued on gears and climbing, doing those two things very well.</p>
					<p>This year offered another opportunity, one which we didn't realize was a viable role to play until we went to Destination Einstein in Columbus, a place we can test our robot on an mock field. Our drive team decided to practice playing defense with <a href="http://columbusspaceprogram.weebly.com/" target="_blank">columbus, team #4188</a>, we realized that defense was significantly more valuable than it was last year. To account for this, we overhauled our drive-train to use 6 SIMs (the maximum) instead of 4, giving us extra horsepower. This gave us massive ammounts of speed and power. This is best exemplified by one of our matches where because one of our alliance members was slower than us. we gor behind them and slammed them across the field so we could both get gears.</p>
					<p>The sponsors panel doubles as a way for us to guard our electronics from gears and fuel which could be flying around. In addition, if a gear were caught on us we wouldn't be able to get more due to the rules. Our winch is strong, quick, and consistent. We also have a camera to help us get the winch aligned. By focusing our time and resources, we have created something we are truely satisfied with, but of course will continue to improve.</p>

					<h4>Why it's so Successful</h4>
					<p>This year's robot is practically built for our drive team. They're both speed demons, and we've optimized our robot in several ways to accomodate this <!--insert link to github-link-->. Because of our agressive drivers, the robot is tough as nails. It's a perfect match.</p>
					<p>Something that Weijie (scouting team) noticed was that many teams were trying to do too much, and the things the built to function independently don't seem to function as a whole. Different parts of the robot seem to get in the way of eachother, and there's too much for the driver to keep track of and control. By keeping our design simple, but optimized, we are able to succeed without being a swiss-army knife sort of robot.</p>

					<h4>Strengths</h4><ul>
						<li>6 CIM drive train, very powerful, very fast</li>
						<li>Grippy, Quick, and Consistent Climber</li>
						<li>Sturdy build with protected electrical board</li>
						<li>Passive gear intake mechanism</li><ul>
							<li>Guides gear into position</li>
							<li>lets us quickly discard a bad gear</li>
						</ul>
						<li><a href="https://github.com/robobibb/main-bot-2017" target="_blank">RoboBibb's best code yet (C++)</a></li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Weaknesses</h4><ul>
						<li>Cannot process fuel elements (balls)</li>
						<li>Need to regular velcrow replacements</li>
						<li>We don't have encoders</li>
						<li>gear intake requires some allignment</li>
						<li>2015 (roboRio) control system not durable.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Sir Sophagus - StrongHold (2016)</h3><hr/>
					<p>Although our final product strayed massively from our planned design, in the end we had an effective bot which got us picked at the state level. We had a tough robot which was very functional and did it's set of tasks well. We focused on low-goal and the defenses.</p>

					<h4>Strengths</h4><ul>
						<li>dual-shifting gearbox</li>
						<li>big wheels (speed and versatility)</li>
						<li>good camera placement</li>
						<li>fairly stirdy</li>
						<li>Switching from LabVIEW to C++ opens doors</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Weaknesses</h4><ul>
						<li>ball sometimes gets jammed in shooter</li>
						<li>Electrical and pneumatics unprotected and unorganized</li>
						<li>Not appealing to the eyes</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>2-Chainz - Recycle Rush (2015)</h3><hr/>
					<p>Although this most definitely wasn't our favorite game, along with a few minor challenges, we put in our best effort to our robot, and most importantly had fun.</p>
					<h4>Strengths</h4><ul>
						<li>Using a counter-balance, we were able to make the 6 foot (2 meter) tall robot quite stable</li>
						<li>Paint made parts look attractive at first competition</li>
						<li>arms survived competition</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Weaknesses</h4><ul>
						<li>paint peeled and caused problems</li>
						<li>arms didn't grip bins as planned</li>
						<li>arms bend under weight allowing bins to slide off</li>
						<li>varius parts began to bend under stress</li>

					<h3>Ash Catch'em - Aerial Assist (2014)</h3><hr/>
					<p>This is our team's first ever robot. It's quite an achievement considering it was our team's first year. We had some portions of the robot which rival what we make today.</p>

					<h4>Strengths</h4><ul>
						<li>Catching mechanism functioned perfectly</li>
						<li>High-shooter effective after modifications</li>
						<li>consistent low-goal-shooter</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Weaknesses</h4><ul>
						<li>Topheavy</li>
						<li>picking up ball from floor</li><ul>
							<li>arms needed to befixed after almost every match</li>
							<li>vacuum ball-grabbing mechanism non-functional</li>
						</ul>
