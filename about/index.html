				<h4>Mission</h4>
				<p>Our mission as Macon-Bibb county's only FIRST Robotics Team is to give high shool students from all backgrounds a chance to learn essential skills needed to succeed in STEM careers. As a team, we build robots thorugh the application of the engineering-design process to compete in the FIRST Robotics competition each year.</p>

				<h4>Goals</h4>
				<p>Our primary goal is to inspire an appreciation in mathematics and science technologies in mentors and students alike. We also strive to instill a sense of teamwork and professionalism as well as help students develop important skills.</p>
				
				<h4>FIRST</h4>
				<p>We compete in the FIRST organization’s First Robotics Competition, also known as FRC. 
				The highest level of competition FIRST offers, FRC allows high school students to compete against teams from across the world. The challenge for the season is a different game each year. 
				Teams only have six weeks to build a functioning robot. This means late nights and long workdays on top of school work and other responsibilities. 
				Once the six weeks are up, the robot is “bagged and tagged” so no major changes can be made before competition.</p> 
				
				<h4>Lab</h4> 
				<p>Our lab is located at Howard High School and is where we hold most of our meetings.
				Originally a graphic design room, we have transformed it to a functioning workroom and meeting site.</p>

				<h4>Scouting</h4>
				<p>Oftentimes a team’s ranking at the end of the qualifiers does not fully represent their abilities. This is why scouting is so important. 
				We have created scouting sheets that our scouting team members fill out during each match. At the end of the qualifiers, 
				we use the collected data to calculate the most promising team’s statistics so we are prepared to make good alliance picks.</p>
