				<h2 style= "text-align:center;">About Us</h2>
				<img src="https://robobibb.github.io/imgs/finals-awards.jpg" style="width:100%" />
				<h3 style= "text-align:center;">FIRST</h3>
				<p style= "text-align:center;"> We compete in the FIRST organization’s First Robotics Competition, also known as FRC. The highest level of competition FIRST offers, FRC allows high school students to compete against teams from around the world. Each year a new game is announced as the challenge. Teams only have six weeks to build a functioning robot that will be able to compete. This means late nights and long workdays on top of school work and other responsibilities. Once the six weeks have passed, the robot is “bagged and tagged” so no more changes can be made before competition.</p>

				<h3 style= "text-align:center;">Lab</h3>
				<p style= "text-align:center;">Our lab is located at Howard High School and is where we hold most of our meetings. Originally a graphic design room, we have transformed it to a functioning workroom and meeting site.</p>

				<h3  style= "text-align:center;">Mission</h3>
				<p  style= "text-align:center;">Our mission as Macon-Bibb county's only FIRST Robotics Team is to give high shool students from all backgrounds a chance to learn essential skills needed to succeed in STEM careers. As a team, we build robots through the application of the engineering-design process to compete in the FIRST Robotics competition each year.</p>

				<h3  style= "text-align:center;">Goals</h3>
				<p  style= "text-align:center;">Our primary goal is to inspire an appreciation for mathematics and science in students and mentors alike. We also strive to instill a sense of teamwork and professionalism as well as help students develop important skills.</p>
